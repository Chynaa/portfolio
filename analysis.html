      <h1>Findings and Interface Enhancements</h1>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>I interviewed three people to gain insight into the needs of others who might make their own portfolio and people who might use my site. Specifically, I interviewed one student and two people who would potentially view my portfolio as someone looking to hire me. In these interviews, I asked a bit about their backgrounds and then what they would look for in a portfolio site.</p>

          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>I searched linkedin for portfolio sites created by UX/UI Designers that are currently employed in the field. I selected these three portfolios because their creators have a career I am interested in and some of them even work in companies I am interested in. I completed a thorough analysis of their sites to help me in pinpointing changes I would like to make in my own site. </p>

           <h3>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>
            <p>In the cognitive walkthroughs, I sat with potential users of my site and asked them a series of questions as they used my site. The main challenge here was altering my walkthrough questions as we went because some users naturally did things on my site without explicit direction while others waited for every request to do anything. </p>

           <h3>User Tests</h3>
            <p>The two tests I conducted were the Navigation Test and the Click Test on usabilityhub.com. I choose the Navigation Test because I wanted to be sure that users could understand how to view all the content on my portfolio including navigating back to the home page. I choose the Click Test because I wanted to make sure my button titles were clear. The only issues I had here were testers jokingly selecting the wrong thing and that many testers had difficulty understanding my instructions on the Navigation Test. </p>

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
          <p>After doing all my research and user testing, I have found that I would like to completely overhaul my entire site and redesign it from the ground up. This is the first website I have ever created so before I jump right into overhauling the site I want to work on improving my HTML and CSS skills. I was very unconfident in them when first designing my site and found that I encountered several issues. Some of these issues were never resolved because I was not even sure what to look for in a possible solution. A key feature in this overhaul would be improvement in the responsive design of my site. I believe that if I work on these skills then come back to update my site, things will go much more smoothly this time around.</p>
          <p>Outside of this major design overhaul, I need to add a link to my linkedin profile and resume. I would likely do this using icons symbolizing those two things on my About Me page. When doing competitor analysis, I found that every competitor had a very detailed description of each project and hey made sure to not include just the result. I did not realize this immediately but as someone interested in user research and testing as a career, the design research details are the most important part of each portfolio project. To implement this I would like to take advantage of the single page scrolling style that looks like you are navigating between multiple pages. Finally, I believe adding a navigation bar to the top of my site will be of high value to users. For now, if they are not already on the home page they must return the home page to access a different page of the site.</p>
          <p>Even though I want to wait to make most of my other changes, I did make one small change to the color of the center background bar on my site. Several people told me that the black text on the black transparent background was too difficult to read. After trying a few alternatives, I found that changing it to a grey transparent color was better for reading site content.</p>
